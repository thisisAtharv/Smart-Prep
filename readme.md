## System Architecture

Smart Prep follows a layered design:

1. **Presentation Layer** (Streamlit UI) – Handles user interactions and displays content.
2. **Application Layer** (Python Logic) – Implements business rules: authentication, content retrieval, and quiz evaluation.
3. **Data Layer** (MongoDB & SQLite) – Stores unstructured and structured data respectively.

Components communicate via lightweight API calls and internal module imports, ensuring modularity and scalability. citeturn0file1
